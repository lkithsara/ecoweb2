            <p>This word clearly defines a product which is not environmentally damaging.
                It can be more complex than that, though, because there are many reasons that may be "harmful to the
                environment.
                " So many different items can have a detrimental effect on the environment, such as not using
                appropriate protocols when goods are disposed of.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are, however, many advantages of using eco-friendly goods that are not only based on the Earth's
                health and well-being, but also your family's health and well-being.

            <h1>Benifits of Eco-Friendly products</h1>
            <img src="images/judge-gavel-plastic-cup.jpg" alt="image"><br>
            <p>Overall, these items are state-of-the-art, modern, and can always save you cash and help you reduce
                waste, but they are more than just good for you.
                The earth needs our support in today's climate.
                Our resource exploitation and misuse has placed the world in a difficult situation, and we are the only
                ones who can stop the damage.

            <p>
                Although it can be difficult to make a huge difference as an individual,
                it is a great way for each person to engage in the preservation of our planet and environment to
                conserve resources and use eco-friendly products.

            <p>All the materials we use can be easily found in sri lanka and are bio degradable. Some of the raw
                materials are cotton, cane, jute hemp and paper. Using these materials
                help in manufacturing a high quality product for the customer.
