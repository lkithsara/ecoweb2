    <H1>The Importance Of Eco-Friendly Environment</H1>
    <p>    
    We all know the literal sense of the term eco-friendly. The planet has developed into a global village, where pollution, catastrophes and diseases have spread to the fullest degree. It is very important to conserve the earth and the living things which exist on it in this kind of chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
        As human beings and the dwellers of Mother Nature, we have forgotten that we are responsible for the earth and that this means keeping it safe and protecting its environment from such events. These issues have grown to a much larger extent and, in contrast to this, the concept of eco-friendly or eco-friendly has progressed.In order to recognize this very concept, we first need to understand why we need to be environmentally friendly? There may be many reasons, but the main ones are as follows:
    </p>
        
        
    <ul>
        <li>Environmental problems</li>
        <li>Pollution</li>
        <li>Lower cost</li>
        <li>Healthier lifestyle</li>
        <li>Sustainability</li>
    </ul><br></section><br><br>

    <h1>Effects from the use of Non Eco-Friendly material</h1>
    <img src="images/9 Simple Ways to Cut Plastic Waste.jpg" alt="turtleimage">
    <p>
        Today, the world faces a host of environmental problems and one of the main causes is the use of non-eco-friendly packaging materials for different consumer goods, one of the problems facing the world today, and one of the main reasons is due to the widespread use of non-eco-friendly and non bio degradable packaging of food and other products.
        These packaging materials emit toxic pollutants that affect human health and the environment, or poisonous gases. Eventually, the pollution they bring could wipe away the human race and other living organisms if this and other environmental problems are not resolved.  
    </p>
    <p>
        A non-biodegradable material is a type of material that cannot be broken down by air, sunlight, water and soil. One example is expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and plastic foam. They account for a large part of the waste pile in the landfills and take up more space.
        They are also producing a greenhouse gas called methane. Experts have pointed to this gas as one of the main perpetrators of the rapid rise in global temperature.

        <h1>Overcoming environmental<br>polution</h1>
        <p>
            There will be no pollution if there are no pollutants. And yet, it's easier said than done. Certain bad habits are entrenched, and industrial development somehow carries the concomitant burden of pollution. The cost to business and its commercial ramifications make this rather simple preventive approach more complicated and difficult to implement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone can help by self-education and by adopting good and healthy practices. It is also important that we help raise awareness of the importance of environmental issues, their dire consequences and what can be done.

            We must help fight Global Warming by doing the following steps:

            <li>Plant more trees</li>
            <li>Don’t waste water</li>
            <li>Use eco friendly products</li>
